To start the server: `npm run start-server`
To start the app: `npm start`

Server is using `json-server` which will fake api calls and store/get data from db.json

Your goal is twofold:

- refactor the given app with all functionalities it currently has
- create a feature which allows the user to rate a movie on a scale from 1 to 10

Some guidlines:

- Use reactive approach
- Use best practices
- Take care about structuring of components
- If some variables or classes are not named properly feel free to change it
- There is no need to restyle anything, just focus on the code organization
- There is no need to include any extra libraries to this project
- Take care of code duplication, reusable functions and components and try to optimize code execution
- The newly create movie-rating feature needs to be functional in the first place, do not worry to much about design
- If you think that it might be useful, add some tests

Good luck and have fun!
